ANALISYS

The rates and rides by city type are relatively reciprocal, considering the urban areas as the highest boom, then the suburban ones and finally the rural areas; although they have a minimum percentage, it is considerable considering the percentage of drivers they have.

It is possible that if increase the number of drivers in suburban and rural areas increase the number of rides on those areas. The percentage of drivers in the urban area is higher than the number of rides and fares comparatively, however it is good to increase more drivers since it has good scores of rides.
